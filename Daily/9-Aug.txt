Greedy + Binary Search

1. Instead of finding the pairs directly we can apply binary search over a range of max. differences.
   The range will be from 0 to difference of largest & smallest value of sorted array. The 'mid' variable will store the potential maximum 
   difference
   For every potential max differences we'll implement a Greedy stratergy to determine if we can get required no. of pairs.

2. Given the max. difference 'mid', we traverse the sorted array to form pairs in Greedy manner. Whenever 2 consecutive no.s in the array 
   have difference that is less than or equal to mid, then we pair them together. And at the end of the traversal if we get the required
   number of pairs the that value of 'mid' is feasible.

Time Complexity : O(nlog(m)) 
Space Complexity : O(n)
n = array length
m = difference between max & min value in the array
